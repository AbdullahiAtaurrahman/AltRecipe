                    6 thigh with skin chicken thighs
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Combine shallots, garlic, ginger, lemongrass, and lime leaves in a food processor or blender,
                    and
                    grind
                    into a very fine paste.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet and transfer in the mixture from the food
                    processor.
                    Spread out into an even layer. Sprinkle over the coriander, cumin, turmeric, white pepper, and
                    salt.
                    Cook, stirring, until the mixture starts to caramelize onto the bottom of the pan and has become
                    very
                    fragrant, about 4 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add sambal, brown sugar, soy sauce, chicken broth, and bay leaves, and use a spatula to scrape
                    the
                    bottom of the pan to deglaze. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    With skin side up, make 3 cuts into the center of each thigh, perpendicular to the bone, about
                    1/2-inch
                    apart. Place chicken into the sauce, skin side down, and reduce the heat to between low and
                    medium-low
                </li>
                <li>
                    Baste the top of chicken with sauce. Cover; simmer for 15 minutes. Uncover; turn thighs over.
                    Cook
                    for
                    another 15 minutes, basting occasionally.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Continue to cook, tossing occasionally, until thighs are tender but not falling off the bone,
                    and
                    sauce
                    has reduced and become very thick. If chicken is finished cooking before sauce is reduced,
                    remove
                    the
                    chicken to a plate, set aside, and continue to reduce the sauce a few minutes more. Reduce heat
                    to
                    low
                    plac;e chicken back in until heated through
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, prepare a charcoal grill for medium-high heat. Grill chicken over charcoal, turning
                    and
                    repositioning often, or until about half of the surface is charred, about 2 minutes per side.
                    Less
                    direct heat can be used for less charring, but the smoky bittersweet grill marks are a key part
                    of
                    the
                    dish.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve grilled chicken thighs on top of the sauce, with more sambal if desired
                </li>
            </ol>

                <li>
                    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine peach slices, 1 tablespoon sugar, lemon
                    zest,
                    lemon juice, and half of the vanilla bean seeds in a bowl. Let stand at least 30 minutes to allow
                    the
                    peaches to release their juices
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whisk together flour, 1/2 cup sugar, almond flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.

                <li>

                <li>
                    Place the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in an 8-inch square baking pan and place in the oven to
                    melt,
                    about 3 minutes. Once melted, swirl butter around in the pan to coat the bottom and up the sides.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add milk mixture to the flour mixture and whisk until fully combined
                </li>
                <li>
                    Working quickly, transfer the batter to the warm pan. Spoon the peach slices and any juice collected
